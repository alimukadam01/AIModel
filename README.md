#Residential Recommendation System
This repository contains files for Residential Recommendation System which uses AI to suggest places to live in Karachi, Pakistan to new emigrants 
based on their social, personal and cultural views and mindset.

We've also added blog functionality so that users can create accounts & share their experiences with the aplication and the city.

The application uses multiple python libraries such as pandas & matplotlib for data organization, sk learn for AI Algorithms, django for deploying the application on a website etc.
